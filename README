== Overview

Ohcount is a library for counting lines of source code.
It was originally developed at Ohloh, and is used to generate
the reports at www.ohloh.net.

Ohcount supports multiple languages within a single file: for example,
a complex HTML document might include regions of both CSS and JavaScript.

Ohcount has two main components: a detector which determines the primary
language family used by a particular source file, and a parser which
provides a line-by-line breakdown of the contents of a source file.

Ohcount includes a command line tool that allows you to count individual
files or whole directory trees. It also allows you to find source code
files by language family, or to create a detailed annotation of an
individual source file.

Ohcount includes a Ruby binding which allows you to directly access its
language detection features from a Ruby application.

== System Requirements

Ohcount is supported on Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 and Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Other Linux
environments should also work, but your mileage may vary.

Ohcount does not support Windows.

Ohcount targets Ruby 1.8.6. The build script requires a bash shell. You
also need a C compiler to build the native extensions.

== Source Code ==

Ohcount source code is available as a Git repository:

  git clone git://github.com/andyverprauskus/ohcount.git

== Doc files ==

To build the more extensive Doxygen docs, do
	> cd doc
	> Doxygen Doxyfile

After building the docs, view them with a browser by opening doc/html/index.html.
On a mac, you can install Doxygen with "sudo port install Doxygen".
On Debian/Ubuntu, install with "sudo apt-get instal doxygen".

== Building Ohcount ==

You will need ragel 6.3 or higher, bash, pcre, gcc and SWIG to build ohcount. Once you have them, go to the top directory of ohcount and type:

	> bash build
or > ./build

== Using Ohcount ==

Once you've building ohcount, the executable program will be at bin/ohcount. The most basic use is to count lines of code in a directory tree, run:
	"ohcount" to count the current directory and source code in any child directories

== For additional docs, including how to add a new language, see the Doxygen docs ==

Particularly, for instructions on adding a new language, follow the instructions at doc/html/detector_doc.html
